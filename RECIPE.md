First take 2  bread slices and keep them apart.
Then tke lettuce and then place a few on top of both the bread slices.
Then apply ketchup on one slice of bread and on the other apply the mayonaise.
After applying both the sauces(and the sauce must be there as they are vital for the flavour), then place the desired filling on top of the bread slice which has the ketchup.
Then take the bread slice which has the mayonaise and then place it on top of the other bread slice.
And voila' your sandwich is ready.
